# Sales Data Analyzer

A small, slightly messy but honest script made while learning Python data tools.

## What it does
- Reads `sales_data.csv` (Month,Sales)
- Prints total, average and best month
- Plots a simple line chart of monthly sales

## How to run (mobile-friendly)
1. Put `sales_data_analyzer.py` and `sales_data.csv` in the same folder.
2. Install libraries (if you have pip):
*On Android use Pydroid 3 (it has a pip interface). On iPhone you can use Replit.*
3. Run:
4. If plotting fails on your device (some mobile environments are headless), you’ll still get the printed summary.

## Notes
- CSV must have columns `Month` and `Sales`.
- The script does not reorder months — keep them in calendar order.
